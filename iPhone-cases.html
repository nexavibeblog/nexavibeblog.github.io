            Why iPhone Cases Are Essential
          </h2>
          <p>
            Many iPhone users underestimate the importance of a good case until
            it’s too late. Even minor drops can result in scratches, dents, or
            cracked screens—issues that can be costly to repair. By investing in
            a high-quality iPhone case, you protect your device and extend its
            lifespan. Additionally, cases can enhance grip, reduce the risk of
            accidental drops, and even add a personal touch to your phone.
          </p>
          <h2
